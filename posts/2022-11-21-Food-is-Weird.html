	<p>So it’s 2010, I’m 18 years old, and I’ve left home to live states away with my internet girlfriend. As you know, these types of stories always end so well.</p>
<p>Fast forward two years. I’m drowning in a toxic relationship with no room to breathe. I experienced my needs being crushed by the interminable pressure of a partner who just wasn’t right for me.</p>
<p>The stress led to me giving up my own morals, beliefs, loves, and truly my identity to the situation. I was so deep in it that I couldn’t see the light any more.</p>
<p>My health rapidly plummeted. The diet that we shared didn’t help that; multiple trips to fast food establishments a week, and we felt absolutely deprived if we didn’t eat out at a sit-in at least once a week.</p>
<p>I’d guzzle sugary coffees just to stay awake, and this magic potion that I once lauded so highly now caused me anxiety, and whole-body pain.</p>
<p>I spent years struggling through this. Every week I would find something new to blame my newfound painful existence on.</p>
<p>It was brain lesions. It was cancer. It was zinc. It was gluten. It was milk. It was fibromyalgia. It was chocolate. It was my DNA. It was h pylori infesting my gut.</p>
<p>It was every single thing that spilled out of my web browser’s search results and straight into my screaming amygdala.</p>
<p>Truthfully.. it took a while to figure out what it really was. But it wasn’t comparing my own condition to others that helped me as much as turning inwards.</p>
<p>It was a lack of spirit.</p>
<p>It was in 2010 when I chose this path, because I thought that I knew better.</p>
<p>Eight years later, in 2018 I did something truly bizarre. Led by spirit, that fellow who I’d recently begun to listen to again, I began to eat an entirely meat diet.</p>
<p>In that half-year, I consumed more steak, salmon, bacon, and eggs, than an average American may eat in half a decade.</p>
<p>Nothing else but water.</p>
<p>It was an elimination diet. The purpose was to determine what was causing my illness.</p>
<p>By listening to my body. I did find the answers, and I was slowly able to re-integrate other foods.</p>
<p>Bear in mind this whole time my soul was very, <em>very</em> consistently keeping me informed of the immense pain that I was inflicting with this diet. I’d write long posts to friends about my struggle with this cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p>But it did work, and bizarrely it was what felt right for the time being.</p>
<p>I realized that if I wanted to avoid the obviously forthcoming multiple lives spent living as enslaved cows next to slaughterhouses that I would have to determine a way to heal, so that I could return to a more balanced diet. One that healed not only my body, but also my soul.</p>
<p>Starting by re-introducing broccoli, and then moving to other plants, I began to transition first to a balanced diet that worked for my body, and then, eventually, to a completely vegan diet.</p>
<p>As I healed my body, and as I healed my soul, I also healed my relationship with my partner.</p>
<p>And as that rift healed, as the toxicity coagulated and then dissolved, we realized that it was all that was holding the both of us together.</p>
<p>Without our toxic habits, we had nothing to talk about. Nothing to do together. We were suddenly strangers.</p>
<p>It was in 2010 that I began this path to learn this lesson. In 2022 I moved out, and in 2022 I am healed.</p>
