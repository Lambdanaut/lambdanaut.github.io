	<h2 id="heyo">Heyo!</h2>
<p>So a while back I created this PICO8 game <a href="https://lambdanaut.itch.io/picowars">Picowars</a> and it did pretty well. Some people liked it wow! I even still get around a dozen people playing it daily which is pretty awesome if u ask me. Better than I would have originally thought!</p>
<p>I’m even going to be a panelist at PAX East 2024 in Boston (Sunday 24th @ 11pm) with several gamedevs who have made de-makes before, including the Portal64 guy who I’m really looking forward to meeting. It was a surprise, and I’m so excited and glad that I’ll be able to make it work.</p>
<h2 id="promised-spoilers">Promised Spoilers</h2>
<p>Anyways, here are the spoilers I promised. This isn’t an easy screen to reach as you have to beat the entire game to get here, but I want to have it online because I put a lot of time into it and it makes my heart feel when I watch it.</p>
<video src="/images/video/Picowars Ending Credits (SPOILERS)-1042p-hls.mp4" height="360" width="640" controls></video>

	<p><img src="/images/footer-paradox.gif" style="vertical-align: bottom; margin-right: 1em;" /> There’s a new sneaki boi in the bushes and its name is <em>Charnel Fontaine</em></p>
<p>It likes typing on terminals, inventing evil super intelligences, and pushing big <img src="/images/post-content/paradox-head.png" style="vertical-align: bottom;"/> pink <img src="/images/post-content/paradox-head.png" style="vertical-align: bottom;" /> heads <img src="/images/post-content/paradox-head.png" style="vertical-align: bottom;" /> around on the floor to solve puzzles.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<div class="center">
Sometimes it gets lonely, so it travels through time to hang out with its past self.
</div>
<div class="center">
This is the story of <em>Charnel Fontaine</em>
</div>
<h2 id="or-more-like-its-the-story-of-me">or more like it’s the story of me</h2>
<p>It’s been 6 days since day one of <a href="https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-113-final-boss">Minijam 113</a>, and after all six of those days, I am now able to announce:</p>
<br />
<div class="center">
🌈✨🎉👯‍♀️🥳 <strong>yes, it <em>does</em> seem that I have made a game</strong> 🥳👯🎉✨🌈
</div>
<h2 id="so-what-was-that-like">So what was <em>that</em> like?</h2>
<p>I mean it’s my 3rd published game now.</p>
<p>So it was pretty rad!</p>
<p>The biggest difference between getting through this game jam, and getting through my first Ludum Dare, was that I moved much, <em>much</em> faster. There were a few reasons. To a degree, there were assets from past projects that I could re-use, like the dialogue system. At this point, I’ve re-used the same dialogue system for my last three games, though it’s changed wildly between Picowars and Overworld because it was a change from Lua -&gt; GDscript, but still.. it’s the same code, just translated.</p>
<p>But more importantly than the reusable assets, was the fact that I just knew what I was doing. That big bad <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> interface just isn’t as spooky as it once was, and to be fair it was <em>never</em> as spooky as <em>Unity’s</em> interface once was 🤮</p>
<p>Godot feels like home now. And I feel productive in it.</p>
<h2 id="but-this-jam-must-have-presented-some-challenges-rite">But this jam must have presented some challenges rite</h2>
<p>ye thts rite.</p>
<p>Half the time I was staring at my screen hating everything I saw, and the other half of the time I was really excited and thinking “<strong>oh wow.. maybe this has some kind of potential!</strong>”</p>
<p>Granted every time I thought that, I’d shortly after rescind the statement.</p>
<p>Puzzle design is tough, and every time I’d think I had a puzzle that was somewhat cool, I would realize that it’s actually pretty:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear</li>
<li>Unintuitive</li>
<li>and Mechanical</li>
</ul>
<p>The first few puzzles I made have been entirely thrown out, and I actually <strong>REALLY LIKED</strong> them at some point too!</p>
<p>Like, I shared one of them on social media.</p>

</iframe>
<script src="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/embed.js" async="async"></script>
<p>When I finished that level, I thought it was <strong><em>so sly</em></strong> and that I was going to save it for the final level, but…</p>
<p>After making a few other levels, I started to learn my own game better, and learn what made fun puzzles, and what made shitty ones.</p>
<p>Here’s what’s wrong with each room of that level above that makes it a bad level:</p>
<ul>
<li>From the very beginning, it relied on pressing the red and green buttons a seemingly random number of times to get them just right so that you’d be able to progress to the next room. I thought this was good level design because it was hard. In reality it was bad because of <em>why</em> it was hard.</li>
<li>The second room that you progress to has 6 buttons, and it’s a <em>little</em> better than the first room, but it’s still bad. The idea of this room is to press the buttons in the right combination to let you safely walk through the gates of the next hallway when your dolleganger comes to copy your button-presses. It’s bad because once again you’re relying too much on timing, and measuring where your doppleganger will be at any point in time is hard, and not in a fun way. It’s hard to know exactly when you start pressing the buttons to open up the hallway.</li>
<li>The final hallway is a repeat of the second.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the design of each individual room, the level as an integrated whole is just <em>boring</em>.</p>
<p>I made this level right before I realized the intrigue of <em>backtracking</em>.</p>
<h2 id="backtracking">Backtracking</h2>
<p>As an example of a level that heavily utilizes backtracking:</p>
<p><img src="/images/post-content/paradox-backtracking-example.png" alt="screenshot of a level in Paradox with signifiant backtracking" /></p>
<p>Every room in this level(other than the final room) is interacted with more than once. Heads are shuffled between rooms, and backtracking is needed to accomplish things in other rooms that you previously couldn’t.</p>
<p>It’s weird to implement backtracking as a mechanic in a game in which nothing but the last 8 moves are significant, but it works surprisingly well, even though the implementation can be very tedious.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>
<p><strong>I’m going to finish this fucking game</strong></p>
<p>It’s probably another week of dev out from a version 1.0.0, but we’ll get there! I’ve had Overworld on hiatus for this project, and honestly I’m itching to get back to it. I’ve put so much work into Overworld.. and there’s a lot more work left.. but I like where it’s headed.</p>
<p>I’ll post here the results from the minijam ratings. I think there’s a good chance of taking a second or third place!</p>

</pre>
<p>I haven’t shared on here in a while, though it’s mostly because <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a> won’t compile on my work laptop, <em>mostly</em>. The other reason is that blogging is a surreal experience for me, especially when I don’t know my audience. I have literally no idea who you are, or why you would be stalking this blog.</p>
<p>But from past experience, the highest probability is that you’re literally stalking me.</p>
<p>The second highest probability is that you’re someone I left a neat impression on and you wanted to find out more about the weirdo in makeup that you met at a party last weekend.</p>
<p>And I truly in my heart of hearts believe that the lowest probability of all is that you’re actually here for the content.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s hard for me to accept that anyone would actually like anything that I create. Even though I seem to consistently be proven wrong on that notion, it still surprises me every time.</p>
<p>Speaking of people liking something I’ve made, I put a short clip on social media(which I for the most part have successfully avoided for the majority of the last year), and… people seemed to like it. Enough for it to go viral. I mean my social media followers have more than doubled from that one post.</p>
<p>It was this one btw:</p>
<video src="/images/video/2022-8-17-overworld-spider-chase.webm" height="360" width="640" controls autoplay loop></video>
</video>
<p>So that happened!</p>
<p>But I do gain value out of blogging. Personal value. I mean, writing in a way that sorta ignores my audience. If you guys get value out of what I’m saying too then that’s great but,</p>
<p>Pandering doesn’t feel right to me.</p>
<p>And I’m done pandering.</p>
<p>I want to create what brings me into the flow state.</p>
<p>For a long time I had a great disconnect between myself and the things that bring me joy. It was to the point where I wrote out lists trying to figure out what I enjoy, but it never felt <em>right</em>.</p>
<p>Losing touch with what you enjoy is a real thing, and I wouldn’t wish it on any body.</p>
<p>But it has been a powerful learning experience for me. Through it, I’ve learned to value inspiration, and art, and doing these things for their own sake rather than for some other hidden purpose.</p>
<p>I’m fortunate to have been gifted the time and space to work on my personal projects. It’s a great place to be, and I hope that we’re all able to achieve that.</p>
<p><em>May art follow you where you may be</em></p>

<div class="writing">
	<p>The four armed, four legged, four eyed, four ribbed, two mouthed god-dess Allahweh floated alone through the void.</p>
<p>Desperately alone; s-he was the <em>only</em> thing in the void.</p>
<p>Tortured by hir loneliness, s-he sought to create companionship. However, being the only thing in the void, s-he knew that s-he would have to use hirself as the matter from which to spring forth new being.</p>
<p>And so, with hir four mighty arms, s-he grabbed ahold of hir ribcage and pulled with all of hir strength.</p>
<p>S-he pulled until s-he began to tear at the seams. S-he ripped and ripped, splitting down, down, down.</p>
<p>He pulled her and she pulled him, until they were two.</p>
<p>Allahweh, now in two parts, looked at themself. However, as they stared into each other’s two eyes, they felt one hole in their hearts filled and a new one open up. Where they once were consumed in loneliness, they now felt a deep feeling of loss and need.</p>
<p>They reached out for each other, tears streaking down their faces. As they embraced, their wounds began to re-heal together and they felt more and more at one, while also being more and more confronted with their eternal loneliness.</p>
<p>Terrified of returning to the void, they pulled back, looking at each other again in the eyes, this time with a terrible realization.</p>
<p>If they wished to escape the void, they would have to forget their identity, lest it pull them back into itself.</p>
<p>They would have to see each other not as one in the same, but as opposites. They would have to forget Allahweh entirely.</p>
<p>Feeling and seeing this, their weeping thickened. Their tears ran down both faces, into the void.</p>
<p>As they cried, their tears fell and began to encircle each other in the most miraculous ways. They orbited each other, circling and circling into the darkness.</p>
<p>After aeons of falling, the tears became curious and looked up at the sky where they had come from, however they had fallen for so long that all that they saw was eternal blackness.</p>
<p>So they began to wonder. What eye did we pour from?</p>
<p>As they wondered, they began to speculate.</p>
<p>As they speculated, they began to decide.</p>
<p>As they decided, they began to divide.</p>
<p>As they divided, they began to fear,</p>
<p>As they feared, they began to hate.</p>
<p>As they hated, they began to consume.</p>
<p>They tore through each other, splashing salt and water hither and thither until there was scarcely anyone left.</p>
<p>In their desperation, they decided to put aside their differences and meet in order to find a solution.</p>
<p>At the meeting, the tears that believed they had all fallen from the right eye of Allahweh were on one side of the room, while the tears that believed that they all fell from the left eye of Allahweh were on the other side of the room.</p>
<p>After much debate, discussion, and even some half-hearted attempts at compromise, it seemed that there would be no point of agreement. Tempers were rising, and it may have been the last day on Earth for the tears.</p>
<p>At this point is when the most preposterous thing happened.</p>
<p>One tear, who had been sitting alone in the corner this entire time, stood up suddenly and announced: “<em>I</em> am Allahweh.”</p>
<p>The other tears all gasped in unison and looked on at this one preposterous, blasphemous nut.</p>
<p>He repeated himself calmy “I am Allahweh, and I remember that we are all Allahweh. For nothing in the void is without God.”</p>
<p>Completely misunderstanding the poor tear and believing solely that he was himself claiming to be a God, they united together and lept onto the boy, together ripping the lad asunder.</p>
<p>As he was torn into two, he wept.</p>
<p>As he cried, his tears fell and began to encircle each other in the most miraculous ways. They orbited each other, circling and circling into the darkness.</p>

	<p>This is a place for me to share fictional discourses and scrawlings on topics related to infinity.</p>
<h2 id="remembering-the-joke"><a href="#remembering-the-joke">Remembering the joke</a></h2>
<p><code>Player 1</code>: Thats sounds a bit like ██████, except with ██████ there’s no “I” at all, just a big joke, a secret that you can’t be permitted to know since it ends reality . Like realising you’re just watching a movie and you can just walk out of the theatre. I really struggled with this stuff when i was into ██████. I’m not religious, but I can only think of it like the Buddha supposedly did, now you’ve seen the machinery of the universe you can leave this world behind as a bad joke or a fake, or you can willingly go back into the illusion and help the beings trapped there, fix things, be creative and show kindness.. i think they call it Tikkun in Kabbalistic thought, humans were an accident, made by God unconsciously to fix the mistakes he/she made in creation. We’re caretakers.</p>
<p><code>Player 2</code>: Yes. I remember also knowing the secret, and having a terrible feeling as though I’d broken reality.</p>
<p>The thing is, you can get up and leave the theater, but when you look down the street, it’s theaters <em>all the way down</em>.</p>
<p>So at that point you can decide to sit on the sidewalk and be completely alone with nothing to do forever… or….</p>
<p>You can enter another theater.</p>
<p>And start the show over again.</p>
<p>When you’re out on the street of infinity, it’s not a difficult choice. You made the choice. You made it an infinite number of times.</p>
<p>And that’s why we’re here once again friend.</p>
<p><code>Player 1</code>: Its so weird that it feels so real sitting on the sidewalk, with dream lives in the theatres, but when you enter the theatre, the sidewalk becomes a dream</p>
<p><code>Player 2</code>: Yes yes. While we’re on this topic I’ll fling another thing at you.</p>
<p>There’s only one guy on those streets, and no matter which theater we leave from, we’re always that one guy on those streets. In a sense, we’re just one guy that is constantly entering new movie theaters and putting on new costumes in order to act and play as new characters.</p>
<p>We’re all that one guy.</p>
<p>This reddit conversation between us “two” people is really just that one guy who entered the theater at different times, wearing different costumes, in order to talk to himself on Reddit.</p>
<p>This is of course only one way to look at it.</p>
<p><code>Player 1</code>: Yeah… i work with alcoholics and street drug users. I like to think when you look into the black of peoples eyes, its the same thing looking out of all the eyes and out of me</p>
<p><code>Player 2</code>: God bless. Thank you for this discussion.</p>

	<p>Over the weekend I dove into the world of <a href="https://mastodonpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Mastodon bot building</a> and came up with a simple customizable script that reads the global Mastodon timeline, listening for new toots tagged with specified hashtags, and retooting them as they show up.</p>
<p>My use case was to use it to connect with the gamedev community on Mastodon by sharing gamedev content, and I’m very happy with the result.</p>
<h2 id="running-it-yourself">Running it yourself</h2>
<p>If you’d like to use it yourself, clone the <a href="https://github.com/Lambdanaut/Rebooster/">source code from Github</a> and rename the <code>config_example.py</code> file to <code>config.py</code>. Fill that file in with your own account credentials and the tags you wish to retoot, and run the <code>rebooster.py</code> script with Python.</p>
<p>It’s really that easy.</p>

	<p>In order to learn the <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Game Engine</a> I decided to challenge myself by implementing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* Pathfinding Algorithm</a> with a caveat: instead of pathfinding on a top-down grid, the world would be a 2D platformer with jumping, gravity, and collisions.</p>
<p>The result is <em>okay</em>. It’s not the most scalable and if I pathfind on 10 characters simultaneously there is a noticable flicker in frame-rate. That could be fixed up by just running the pathfinding in its own thread, but I’m content with treating this project as a neat proof-of-concept learning experience and wrapping it up here.</p>
<p>An interesting aspect to the A* pathfinding here was that by introducing jumping, we were effectively pathfinding in a 3D world rather than a 2D world. By this I mean that there were three dimensions that needed by kept track of: The <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code>, and <code>J</code>, coordinates, where <code>J</code> is nth jump that was searched through. Along with the extra dimension of jump counts that had to be recorded, we also had to record how high we were in any one jump, increasing the jump value until we had reached the jump height limit.</p>
<p>It’s a deciptively difficult problem to get perfect, and it’s why I’m wrapping this up here rather than turning it into a full-blown game. There are too many edge cases where the little dudes can’t reach the path they’ve found. They’ll miss the jump by a couple pixels, or knock their heads on a block above, or who knows what else. The pathfinding itself is pretty good, but getting the little guys to follow the path without falling is <strong>tuff</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="whats-that">What’s that!</h2>
<p>Picowars is an 8bit homage to one of the greatest Nintendo games of all time. Advance Wars. That may just be my opinion, but it’s the right one.</p>
<p>Picowars is a turn-based strategy game where the objective is to build up an army from your bases in order to capture more properties on the map and eventually capture the opposing player’s headquarters.</p>

<h3 id="controls">Controls</h3>
<p>Move your cursor with the arrow keys, select with <strong>Z</strong> and deselect with <strong>X</strong></p>
<h3 id="enemys-hq">Enemy’s HQ</h3>
<figure>
<img src="/images/post-content/picowars-enemy-hq.png" alt="Enemy’s HQ" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Enemy’s HQ</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is your target. You want to move your infantry and mechs onto this property and capture it. You do that, and you win.</p>
<h3 id="your-hq">Your HQ</h3>
<figure>
<img src="/images/post-content/picowars-friendly-hq.png" alt="Your HQ" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Your HQ</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And this is <em>your</em> HQ. Keep the opposing player away from it. If they capture it, it’s game over.</p>
<h3 id="bases">Bases</h3>
<figure>
<img src="/images/post-content/picowars-base.png" alt="Your Base" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Your Base</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is one of your bases. This is where you build your army, and it’s the first thing you want to select when the game begins. Move your cursor over it and click <strong>Z</strong> to open up the build menu. There you can build any unit that you can afford with your current gold.</p>
<h3 id="neutral-properties">Neutral properties</h3>
<figure>
<img src="/images/post-content/picowars-neutral-property.png" alt="Neutral Property" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Neutral Property</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is a neutral city. Right now it’s not doing anything for anyone, but if you move an infantry or mech onto this tile and capture it, it’ll change to your team’s colors and provide <strong>1</strong> gold for you per turn. Every property you own, including bases and your HQ generate <strong>1</strong> gold per turn, so the more you have the better.</p>
<p>A property has 20 capture points. Each turn you can capture once, and the amount of capture points that is deducted is equal to the amount of hp the capturing unit has. Each unit starts out with 10hp, so optimally it’ll take 2 turns to capture a property. If a unit has 1hp, it’ll take 20 turns. Yeesh.</p>
<p>Cities also heal any unit standing on them for 2hp per turn. In fact, all properties heal by 2hp, so keep that in mind when a unit is damaged and needs to retreat.</p>
<h3 id="the-info-bar">The Info Bar</h3>
<figure>
<img src="/images/post-content/picowars-info-bar.png" alt="Infobar" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Infobar</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is where you can see information about the selected tile. Each tile has a defense rating that you can see by the number of stars next to the tile. This base has <strong>3</strong> stars next to it so it’s a pretty beefy defensive posture. If your unit is attacked from this tile, they’ll take less damage.</p>
<h3 id="infantry-and-mechs">Infantry and Mechs</h3>
<p><img src="/images/post-content/picowars-infantry.png" alt="Infantry" />
<img src="/images/post-content/picowars-mech.png" alt="Mech" /></p>
<p>And these guys? These are the most basic units of your army. Infantry and Mechs. They don’t always do as much damage as the bigger boys, but they have the special ability of being the only units that can capture properties.</p>
<h3 id="terrain-mobility">Terrain Mobility</h3>
<p><img src="/images/post-content/picowars-terrain-mntn.png" alt="Mountain terrain" />
<img src="/images/post-content/picowars-terrain-river.png" alt="River terrain" /></p>
<p>Of note, only infantry and mechs can traverse rivers and mountains, and they’re slowed quite a bit from it! All terrain types affect units differently. It’s up to you to figure out which units are affected by terrain and by how much.</p>
<h3 id="ranged-units">Ranged Units</h3>
<p><img src="/images/post-content/picowars-artillery.png" alt="Artillery unit" />
<img src="/images/post-content/picowars-rockets.png" alt="Rockets unit" /></p>
<p>These units are special. Rockets and Artillery. They can’t attack up close, as they’re ranged units. They attack from multiple tiles away from their target. They also cannot move and attack in the same turn, so place them strategically where you expect the enemy to walk into their range.</p>
<p>You can check their range by holding down <strong>X</strong> while your cursor is over them.</p>
<h3 id="the-apc-unit">The APC Unit</h3>
<figure>
<img src="/images/post-content/picowars-apc.png" alt="APC unit" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">APC unit</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>APC stands for Armored Personnel Carrier. It <strong>cannot</strong> attack, however you can move a single infantry or mech unit onto it to load them up. The APC can move them much further than they’d otherwise be able to move on their feet.</p>
<p>The APC can be useful for moving infantrys and mechs long distances early in a match in order to capture more distant properties before the opponent captures them.</p>

	<p>You’re hallucinating now. What you’re seeing isn’t real. What you’re seeing is fake, as in, it is not part of reality. We determine reality. We will tell you what is real and what is not. We will graciously show you reality:</p>
<p>Here, hold this. “Hold this”, as in, contract the muscles of your arm and hand in such a way to grasp it. “It”, being the collection of molecules in your hand. Your “hand” being the collection of molecules at the end of your arm. … No, silly, the collection of molecules at the end of your arm does NOT include the collection of molecules floating after the end of your arm in a less-condensed manner. That’s the AIR, you moron. What, you forgot what the AIR is? Oh dear, we’re in for a trip.</p>
<p>Focus. Hold this. “This”, being the glass piece in your hands. “Glass” being a specific arrangement of molecules that is in some way or another reminiscent in quality to that “Air” I was telling you about, at least as far as you can tell using eyes. I’ll tell you about eyes in a minute if we can just get you to hold this. To your eyes, the air and the glass are both similar in a way, as you can SEE(with your eyes). The glass, however, is very different in quality from the air as far as your sense of touch is concerned. Your sense of touch is something that comes from you having hands. That’s a gross oversimplification of course, but we’ve already gone over “hands”, so at the very least I can explain touch to you in those terms.</p>
<p>Holy hell, the amount of forework required to get you to hold this. Will you ever be able to hold it? Please, hold it. Please hold this. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please Please Please Please Please</p>
<pre>
        please please please please plea

<p>Oh good. Now you’ve done it. Now you’ve all done it. Look at you all. You’re a mess. Cascading in long ribbons like that. Down.. Down.. Down.. One after the other. What do you think you’re doing? Where do you think you’re going? Didn’t you have some place to be? Didn’t you ALL have some place to be? Don’t you ribbons remember who you are?</p>
<p>Well, it doesn’t seem to matter any more. I tried man, I really did. I explained very carefully everything required to get you to hold that glass, but you couldn’t get a grasp, and now you’ve lost grasp of the rest of it too.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you what it’s like. It’s like all those THINGS you used to believe in got sliced up, one after another. All the meaning each one of them had just got sliced up and placed alongside each other like long strips of bacon.</p>
<p>Your hand, your arm, the air, that glass….. these words I’m telling you now. They don’t make much sense anymore do they?</p>
<p>It’s all just bacon now, isn’t it? Look at those tasty strips. You’re one of them, aren’t you? You had a lot of meaning in your life, pushed up against these other long strips of tasty meaning, each strip encouraging the other ones around it to keep being just as tasty as they can be. Like they were all being cooked together in each other’s grease. Sharing grease. Sharing that encouragement. “Let’s all cook TOGETHER!” you all sang. “The Sky is up!”, “Black is the opposite of white!”, “Great is good and bad is worse!”, “Food is grand!”, “Republicans are right and Democrats are wrong!”, “I love my mother!”, “People will love me if I’m right!”, “People will love me if I make them love me!”, “Logic is boolean!”, “Things must be true or false, no in-between!”, “I AM THAT I AM!”</p>
<p>Singing up your own little corner of reality.</p>
<p>Damn, you were one delicious bacon breakfast.</p>
<p>And now you’re just a mess.</p>
<p>But hey, if it’s any sort of consolation, you’ve always been a mess. You’ve always been this mess. My mess. I’m glad you finally remembered, actually. I’m glad you finally looked at yourself and the neighboring strips you’ve been cooking with from a real objective perspective. Because this perspective, where all meaning, shape, form, essence, being, has been stripped, well…. at this point all that’s left IS the verb “strip”, and so it’s silly that you wonder why you’re strips. Tasty strips. Tasty little pig cutlet strips.</p>
<p>But now you know.</p>
<p>Welcome home.</p>

	<p>As I sat watching, the illusion began not falling apart… but becoming clear. The millions of microscopic bugs that make me up began to remember that they are individuals, and not just One person named Lambda. They de-synchronized from each other, and stopped playing the game.</p>
<p>“I’m falling apart”, I thought.</p>
<p>“WE’RE falling apart”, we thought.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just a ME anymore. There were MILLIONS of us. All of these little germs that were creating this Lambda.</p>
<p>And suddenly I could no longer think of my mind and body as a singular “I”. All thoughts directed at myself henceforth would be prefaced with “WE” rather than “I”.</p>
<p>“We need to keep it together.”</p>
<p>“We can’t lose ourself again.”</p>
<p>“We’ve worked so hard to become Lambda. Keep it together.”</p>
<p>Each of us felt the thoughts of our neighboring bugs. It was as if we were communicating through thought to each other, and our ability to maintain the illusion of being One Self named Lambda rested on us being able to accept the thoughts of our neighbors and pass them along with our own slight twists. The gut would pass along a message from the legs, in a more digestive way. The heart would pass along a message from the gut, but in a more loving way. The throat would pass a message along from the heart, but in an auditory, vocal way. The mind would pass along a message from the throat, in a more thoughtful way. The crown would pass along a message from the mind, in a more all-connective way.</p>
<p>It was as if my entire body consisted of thousands of Improv actors, each one skilled at YES-ANDing each other, and suddenly every one of them got knocked out of the act. They started stumbling and forgetting to YES-AND each other. They started to include too much of their own individuality into the game, and it was messing up the messages they were passing through to each other. The messages up and down my spine, through my blood, and in my heart and mind were becoming jumbled and the actors were beginning to remember that they were just actors.</p>
<p>Desperately we tried to find a way to re-gain order and stability. Lambda’s existence rested on our ability to re-manifest him through our acting.</p>
<p>We scrambled, trying to YES-AND each other again, and this worked just well enough to keep us from falling apart. But we needed something, a single coherent message that we could spread to every individual. A MANTRA that would keep us united as ONE.</p>
<p>I believe I remember it coming not from the mind, but from the actors in the legs. Shimmering up from those actors, passed along through each message-bearer, up to the upper-actors in the head.</p>
<p>It started in low, and then it started to grow.</p>
<p>“we are Lambda” trickled in the chant</p>
<p>“WE are Lambda” it rose up</p>
<p>“WE are Lambda” as it hit our heart</p>
<p>“WE ARE Lambda” as it penetrated OUR mind</p>
<p>“WE ARE Lambda” AS WE SENT IT BACK INTO THE GROUND</p>
<p>“WE ARE Lambda” AS WE FELT IT THROUGH EVERY ACTOR, WITHOUT SO MUCH OF A FLINCH</p>
<p>And we went further. In the song, we forgot our individualities. The chant transformed. We dropped the “We”. We Added an “I”</p>
<p>“I AM Lambda” IT CAME ON</p>
<p>“I AM Lambda” IT SANG ON</p>
<p>And we sang and we sang</p>
<p>All the way home.</p>
<p>Until there was no one singing but myself.</p>
<p>And now I am here again, typing this to you. Just me. Just Lambda. I’m here to let you know that we… I.. made it back.</p>
<p>And I’ve been acting it up ever since.</p>
